# 05 Version Control

## Git 


### Why do I need that again?

<img style="align: left;width: 450px;" src=images/phd_comics_final.png />

Version control is very useful to **keep track of changes you made to your scripts**. It allows you to choose when you have reached a stage in your code that you think is worth keeping track of, like a new function that makes your data analysis soooooo much better. 

For scientists, version control is a useful tool to help you to track changes you make to your scripts and enable you to share your codes with your collaborators. For example, if you break your code, git can help you to revert to an earlier working version. Want one of your collaborators to add a feature to your code to do a specific analysis? Version control can help you to do so in a smooth and organized manner, tracking who changed what.

This training material focuses on the code verioning system calld `Git`. Note that there are others, such as `Mercurial` or `svn` for example.

### What is git?

<img style="float: right;width: 100px;" src="images/git_icon.png">

![xkcd - git, aka what we want to avoid!](images/git_xkcd.png)

Git is a *free* and *open source* distributed *version control system*. It has many functionalities and was originally geared towards software development and production environment. In fact, Git was initially designed and developed in 2005 by Linux kernel developers (including Linus Torvalds) to track the development of the Linux kernel. Here is a [fun video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8) of Linus Torvalds touting Git to Google. 

### How does it work?

Git can be enabled on a specific folder/directory on your file system to version files within that directory (including sub-directories). In git (and other version control systems) terms, this “tracked folder” is called a **repository** (which formally is a specific data structure storing versioning information).

#### More details:
  
- Git stores snapshot of your files (that have changes) 
- Git is distributed, meaning that all the copies of your repository are of equal value, containing all your codes and its history. There is no central repository
- Git has integrity, meaning each file is checked (summed) to be sure there was no bit loss during any file manipulation by git. Each snapshot (also called commit) has a unique identifier.

### What git is not

- Git is not a backup per se
- Git is not GitHub (or more exactly: GitHub is not Git)
- Git is not good at versioning large data (there are work around that)


## The Git workflow

### Overview
<img style="float: right;width: 300px;" src="images/git_workflow_general.png">

1. You modify files in your working directory and save them as usual

2. You **add** snapshots of your changes files to your staging area

3. You do a **commit**, which takes the files as they are in the staging area and permanently stores them as snapshots to your Git directory.

**And repeat!!**

Every time you create a new snapshot, you add the new version of the file to the database, while keeping all the previous versions in the database. It creates an history that is like a graph that you can navigate:

<img style="align: left;width: 200px;" src=images/version-graph_mattJones.png />


## Getting started with Git

_[TRY GIT in 15min!](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)_

Before you start using git on any computer, you will have to set your identity on your system, as every snapshot of files is associated with the user who implemented the modifications to the files.

### 1. Setting up your identity

You need to do this step the first time you use git on a computer.

**Setup your profile:**

Your name and email: 

```bash
git config --global user.name "yourName"
git config --global user.email "yourEmail"
```

**Optional:**

Check that everything is correct: 

```bash
git config --global --list
```

Modify everything at the same time:

```bash
git config --global --edit
```

Set your text editor: 

```bash
git config --system core.editor vim
```

Cache your GitHub credentials (for 1 hour):

```bash
git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'
```

How to change the default [text editor](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) used by git? How make git remember your [GitHub credentials](https://help.github.com/articles/caching-your-github-password-in-git/#platform-all)?

### 2. Starting a git repository

As we mentioned earlier, a **git repository** is a folder/directory on your machine in which content is monitored for any changes by git.

#### A.) Start versioning an existing folder on your system

`git init` is the command to start the tracking in a specific directory and transform it into a git repository:

```bash
mkdir oss
cd oss
mkdir dessert
cd dessert
pwd
git init
```

#### B.) Copying an existing repository to your system

`git clone` is the git command to copy an existing repository to your machine, more precisely adding the repository to the directory you are in.

```bash
cd 
mkdir oss
cd oss
git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_reponame.git
```
The cloning process will automatically create a directory on your machine named like the online repository.

### Tracking your changes

Let us have a closer look at the git workflow. It is important to stress that almost all of the git workflow happens on your local machine:

![](images/git_commands_workflow_new.png)

### Example

Navigate in the `dessert` repository you just created.

1.) Let us create a csv file containing our name and favorite dessert:

```bash
vim favorite_desserts.csv
```
2.) Edit the new file adding headers and your info:

Note: hit the key `i` to switch to *insert mode* in vim. My file would look like this

```
Name, Dessert
Julien, Ice cream
```

Exit the insert mode  `esc` 

Exit vim and save `:wq`

3.) Add the new file to git:

```bash
git status
git add favorite_desserts.csv
git status
git commit -m "Julien's favorite dessert"
git status
```
4.) Add a friend to the csv:

```bash
vim favorite_desserts.csv

My name, My desert
Julien, Ice cream
Eliott, Crepes
```
Save and exit vim by typing `:wq`

5.) Add (stage) and commit the new version of the file

```bash
git status
git add favorite_desserts.csv
git status
git commit -m "Adding Eliott's favorite dessert"
git status
```

6.) Check the differences between the two last commits:

```bash
git diff HEAD~1
```

Note: hit `q` to exit


7.) We can also look at the log of commits to look a the commit sequence

```bash
git log

git log -1
```


## Getting information about git

* `git status` this command is your friend! It will tell you where you are at and what are your options. You can use at any point in your process.
* `git log` displays history of committed snapshots. It lets you list the project history, filter it, and search for specific changes.
* `git diff --cached`
To be used before committing, to preview the changes to be committed. 
* `git diff HEAD~1 my_script.R` to inspect the changes between the last commit (HEAD) and the previous one
* `git diff HEAD~2 my_script.py` to inspect the changes between the last commit (HEAD) and 2 commits before.


Git has a lot of terms and commands, see reference at the end of this document for an extensive terminology.

## Ignoring certain types of file

`.gitignore` is a specific file used to list what (type of) files you do not want git to track. This file need to be placed at the top level of the directory.

File content example from GitHub:
<https://gist.github.com/octocat/9257657>

To create this file from the terminal/shell:

```bash
vim .gitignore
```

To know more: <https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore>


## Undoing things

### Unstage a file

`git reset HEAD` lets you remove a file from the staging area

```bash
git reset HEAD <my_file_I_added_by_mistake.xls>
``` 
This will remove the file from your next commit. Can be used to undo an erroneous `git add`.

### Undo your last commit

`git commit --amend` let you amend your last commit with the most recent changes, like for example if you forgot a file

```bash
git add <missing_script.R>
git commit --amend -m "My new message"
```

More info about how to undo things [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Undoing-Things)

### Undo your changes

***Warning!*** `git checkout` overwrite the file version by the latest committed one => your changes will be lost!

```bash
git checkout -- test_file.txt
``` 

You can also revert a file to a former commit in the history using the unique commit hash

```bash
git checkout e11e34 test_file.txt
``` 

## Few other terms you might have heard

* **HEAD**: it is the reference that points by default to the latest commit
* **Branches**: A branch represents an independent line of development, parallel to the master. In fact, the default branch name that is created by ```git init``` is called ***master***.


## Collaborating with git and GitHub

***So far we have used git locally, on one machine***. One strength of git and GitHub are great collaborative tools enabling you to share and co-edit codes and files with other researchers. Git and GitHub can also help you to move files between machines (your work desktop, your laptop, servers, ...) and keep the files synchronized across these machines.

### Adding remotes to your workflow

It is important to highlight that a good portion of the workflow happens on your local machine (in green) and a part requires interactions with a remote machine (in blue):

#### Sequence order: 

1.) `git add`  Select the files you would like to take a snapshot of

2.) `git commit -m "my descriptive message"`  Take the snapshot adding a descriptive note

-------------------------------------------  REMOTE  -------------------------------------------

3.) `git pull` : be sure you have the latest version of the picture album from the server

4.) `git push` : send your latest version of the picture album to the server


![](images/git_push_pull_overview.png)


**=> To allow to exchange files with a remote repository, we will first to tell git where this remote repository is located on the Web**


## GitHub
	
You might also have heard of [GitHub](https://github.com). **GitHub is a company that hosts git repositories online** and provides several collaboration features (among which `forking`). GitHub fosters a great user community and has built a nice web interface to git, also adding great visualization/rendering capacities of your data.

* **GitHub.com**: <https://github.com>
* **A user account**: <https://github.com/brunj7>
* **An organization account**: <https://github.com/nceas>
* **NCEAS GitHub instance**: <https://github.nceas.ucsb.edu/> 

### Creating a new repository

We are going to create a new repository on your GitHub account:

* Click on ![image alt text](images/image_10.png)
* Enter a descriptive name for your new repository (avoid upper case and use `-` instead of spaces)
* Choose **"Public"** (Private repositories are not free)
* Check **"Initialize this repository with a README”**
* Add a `.gitignore` file (optional). As the name suggest, the gitignore file is used to specify the file format that git should to track. GitHub offers pre-written gitignore files for commodity
* Add a license file (optional) 

<img style="align: left;width: 100px;" src=images/github_cloud_with_repo.png /> **=> Here it is, you now have a repository in the cloud!!** 


<img style="align: left;width: 35px;" src=images/tip.png /> Here is a website to look for more pre-written`.gitignore` files: <https://github.com/github/gitignore>


## Pushing your local repository to a remote server

This is the case where you already worked in a local repository and you would like to add your local repository to a remote computer or server

First, we will need to create a **bare** remote repository. In this example we wile create a bare repository on GitHub. It is the exact same steps we have seen previously, except we **will not check**`initialize this repository with a README file`. 

Keeping on our `dessert` example, go to your GitHub account and create a new **bare** repository called `dessert`


![](images/bare_repo_created.png)


Then, within your local repository on your computer, you will need to tell git where on the web is located the bare repository ready to receive the entire content of your local repository:

1. Add the remote address: 

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.nceas.ucsb.edu/<my_github_username>/dessert.git
```

2. Do your initial push to the master branch, setting up the upstream tracking. From inside your local dessert repository: 

```bash
git push -u origin master
```

3. Enter your GitHub credentials when asked


![](images/set_remote_existing_repo.png)

The `-u` flag sets the upstream tracking. This allows git to track changes on the remote branch. It also allows you to `pull` without argument (or `merge` to be exact). You only need to set it once (per branch). Note that when you `clone` a repository, the upstream tracking is set automatically to `origin/master`, therefore you can directly use `git push` on the master branch without additional arguments. 


## Cloning a remote repository to your local machine

This is the opposite situation: You would like to bring an exact copy (clone) of a remote repository to your local machine.

In this example we are going to clone to your local machine the repository containing all the teaching material for the OSS:

At the command line, you meed to navigate to the location where you would like to create your new repository. Remember a repository is a directory/folder a the file system level. Note that the cloning process is going to create the directory/folder of the repository, so you should navigate to the folder where you would like the repository to be a sub-folder. Assuming you are in your `dessert` repository and that you want to clone the `oss-lessons` remote repository next to it:

```bash
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/NCEAS/oss-lessons.git
```

This is it! Note that no login was required since anybody can clone a public repository from GitHub.


## Moving codes and files from one computer to a server or another remote machine

We will use the `dessert` repository created in the previous section to illustrate how these tools can be used to move your work to another machine and help you to keep versions up-to-date between these machines.

You should be now in the following situation with our dessert example: your local repository should be pushed to github, with the two content being identical:

![](images/git_remote_local_sync.png) 

### Clone the repository to a second machine

First we should bring our repository to the new machine. Since it is not currently on this machine, we will have to clone the repository from GitHub to this computer. In our case, this second machine will be NCEAS analytical server Aurora:

1. Connect to Aurora via the command line using `ssh`

```bash
ssh <username>@aurora.nceas.ucsb.edu
```

2. Clone the repository to your home directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.nceas.ucsb.edu/<my_github_username>/dessert.git
```

![](images/git_clone_repo_server.png)

=> _Now, we have three **exact** copies of our repository on a server, in the cloud and on a desktop._

### Keeping things synchronized

Now, let say we are working on the server to scale up our analysis or in our dessert example write a R script to read the csv about the favorite desserts.

##### Let us add a new person to our csv

1. Go inside the dessert directory

```bash
cd dessert
```

2. Edit the file

```bash
vim favorite_desserts.csv

My name, My desert
Julien, Ice cream
Eliott, Crepes
Sophia, Chocolate ice cream
```

Save and exit vim by typing `:wq`

3. Stage and commit our changes the same way we have done before

```bash
git status
git add favorite_desserts.csv
git commit -m"adding Sophia"
```

OK, where are we at?

![](images/git_server_changed.png)

As you can see, now the git commit history is different on the server than on GitHub and on your computer. You can verify by going to your github account and looking at `favorite_desserts.csv`. These are only two name listed. To implement the latest changes to the dessert repository on GitHub we will have to use `git pull and pull`.

##### pushing the latest changes

When you want to push your change to a repository, it is always good to first pull the latest version of the remote repository to your local repository (the repository on the server in this case) to be sure you have all the changes that might have been created on the online repository

```bash
git pull
git push
```

Enter your GitHub credentials when asked.

Now if you use your web browser to go to your repository on GitHub and click on the `favorite_desserts.csv`. It should have 3 rows.

![](images/git_server_github_synchronized.png)

##### getting the latest changes

Now we want to pull the latest version to our Desktop.

```bash
git pull
```

This is it!, we are back to the situation were we have 3 exacts copies of our dessert repository. 

![](images/git_server_github_desktop_synchronized.png)

Note that you do not need to synchronize your repositories across your machines/locations at every commit. You can work and commit on one machine numerous times before synchronizing with GitHub or another machine.


## <img style="float: left;width: 35px;" src="images/challengeproblemred_scribble.png"/>  Challenge

Write a R code to read the favorite_desserts.csv files in and add a new row to the data frame and overwrite the csv with the new entry. Of course you need to track the development of your code using git!!


## Collaborating with others

### Collaborating through Forking, aka the GitHub workflow

A **fork** is a **copy of a repository** that will be stored under your user account. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.

When you are satisfied with your work, you can initiate a ***Pull Request*** to initiate discussion about your modifications. Your commit history allows the original repository administrators to see exactly what changes would be merged if they accept your request.  

By using GitHub's `@mention` syntax in your Pull Request message, you can ask for feedback from specific people or teams.

### Collaborating through write access

When you collaborate closely and actively with colleagues, you do not want necessarily to have to review all their changes through pull requests. You can then give them write access (`git push`) to your repository to allow them to directly edit and contribute to its content.

#### Adding collaborators to a repository 

* Click on the repository
* On the right panel, click ![image alt text](images/image_11.png)
* On the left pane, click Collaborators and enter the usernames you want to add![collaborators](images/github_collaborators.png) 

#### Adding a team to a repository (organization only)

* Click on the repository
* On the right panel, click ![image alt text](images/image_11.png)
* On the left pane, click Collaborators & teams ![image alt text](images/image_12.png)
* Select your team ![image alt text](images/image_13.png)
* Select the appropriate Permission level. We recommend Write or Admin. Admin allows people to also add collaborators. 

![image alt text](images/image_14.png)




## Managing Merge Conflicts

The most common cause of merge conflicts happens when another user changes the same file that you just modified. It can happen during pull from a remote repository (or when merging branches).

1. If you **know for sure** what file version you want to keep:

 * keep the remote file: ```git checkout --theirs conflicted_file.txt```
 * keep the local file: ```git checkout --ours conflicted_file.txt```

*=> You still have to* ```git add``` *and* ```git commit``` *after this*

2. If you do not know why there is a conflict:
  Dig into the files, looking for:

```bash
<<<<<<< HEAD
local version (ours)
=======
remote version (theirs)
>>>>>>> [remote version (commit#)]
```

*=> You still have to* `git add` *and* `git commit` *after this*

During this process, if you want to roll back to the situation before you started the merge: `git merge --abort`

**NOTE:** By doing a `pull` before committing, you can avoid a lot of git conflicts. Your git workflow should therefore be:

1. `git add`
2. `git pull`
3. `commit -m "descriptive message"`
4. `git pull`
5. `git push`

### Example

Continuing with the `dessert` example we used in the first part of this tutorial, we now have on our local machine


## Branches

![adapted from https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-merge](images/atlassian_branches_sketch.png)

What are branches?  Well in fact nothing new, as the master is a branch. A branch represents an independent line of development, parallel to the master (branch). 

Why should I use branches? For 2 main reasons:

* We want the master to only keep a version of the code that is working
* We want to version the code we are developing to add/test new features (for now we mostly talk about feature branch) in our script without altering the version on the master.

### Working with branches

#### Creating and using a branch

Few commands to deal with branches:

* `git branch`	Will list the existing branches
* `git branch myBranchName` 	Will create a new branch with the
							name myBranchName
* `git checkout myBranchName` Will switch to the branch myBranchName

<img style="float: left;width: 30px;" src="images/tip.png"/> In a rush? create a new branch and switch to it directly:

```bash
git checkout -b branchName
```


**Want to switch back to master?**

```bash
git checkout master
```

***=> Once you have switched to your branch, all the rest of the git workflow stays the same (git add, commit, pull, push)***

#### Creating and using a branch

Done with your branch? Want to merge your new - ready for prime time - script to the master?

1. Switch back to the master: 	```git checkout master```
2. Get the latest version of the master: ```git pull origin master```
3. Merge the branch: 			```git merge myBranchName ```
4. Delete the branch:			```git branch -d myBranchName```


## Version control using RStudio

*Notes:* 

- It is assumed that you already know the basics of version control systems. If not, here is a good hands-on introduction to the Git version control system: <https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1>
- It is also assumed that you already have used git on this computer/server. If not, you must first set up your identity; see here for more details: <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup>.

<img style="float: right;width: 200px;" src=images/image_0.png />

**If you want to use the RStudio interface to control git, you need to create a RStudio Project**. To do so, you should first organize your files in one folder that will become your git repository. Once this is done, you can create a new RStudio Project from the upper-right corner of the RStudio IDE window, choosing *New Project*

Now, you have two options:

* *Create the Project based on an existing folder* (e.g., you already have been working and writing code and you want to start using git versioning on this work)

* *Create the Project from scratch* based on a new empty folder


### Versioning existing work

#### Create the RStudio Project

* Choose *Existing Directory* from the wizard

<img style="align: left;width: 400px;" src=images/image_1.png />

* *Browse* to the main folder containing your data

* *Create Project*

#### Starting git version control 

Now you that have successfully created a RStudio project, you can enable the version control. Go to the *Tools* menu *-> Version Control -> Project Setup…*

![image alt text](images/image_2.png)

This will open a new window. Change the *None* setting by choosing *Git* from the drop-down menu

<img style="align: left;width: 450px;" src=images/image_3.png />

Click *OK*. Answer *Yes* to the 2 following pop-ups to restart RStudio and enable git on your project.

### Versioning new work

If you are starting to work on a new project for which you have not yet started to write code, you can follow these steps to create a new git repository:

* Create a new RStudio Project from the upper-right corner of the RStudio IDE window, choosing *New Project* 

* Choose *New Directory* 

<img style="align: left;width: 450px;" src=images/image_4.png />

Note: The Version control option at the bottom is only to be chosen when you want to clone an existing repository.

* Choose *Empty* *Project*

<img style="align: left;width: 450px;" src=images/image_5.png />

* Give your project (folder) a *name*, *Browse* for its location on your drive. Finally, check the option *Create a git repository* before clicking *Create Project*.

<img style="align: left;width: 450px;" src=images/image_6.png />

**Congratulations, you have a new project with git versioning enabled!!**

### Using git from RStudio

Now that you have enabled git versioning for your Project, a "Git" tab should have been added to your interface next to "Environment" and "History" tabs

![image alt text](images/image_7.png)

Note that the *.gitignore* file is automatically generated by RStudio. It lists all file formats we do not want to track, here specifically the temporary files from R and RStudio. You can edit this document to add any type of file you would like git not to track.

#### Staging

To specify which files you want to track (aka staging), you need to check the boxes in front of the file names. This is the equivalent of the `git add` command.

![image alt text](images/image_8.png)

#### Committing

Then you can do your first commit -taking a snapshot of the current status of your work for the files you have decided to track (stage) -  by clicking on the *Commit* button (above your file names). This is the equivalent of the `git commit` command.

A new window should pop up. Note that certain web browsers will block this pop-up.

<img style="align: left;width: 500px;" src=images/image_9.png />

You need to write a descriptive message of the work accomplished from the last commit in the Commit message window, then you can click the Commit button (below the Commit message window).

Then you can hit the button *Close* and close the commit window as you would close any system windows.

All the committed files should have disappeared from the *Git* tab on the RStudio IDE. A file will reappear when you save new changes. 

And you can start the whole commit process again, once you have reached a milestone in your work!! Commit frequently!! Don't have fear of commitment.

#### Pulling

Once you have committed your changes, you can `pull` the latest version of the repository from GitHub by clicking on the pull button. Conflict may happen during this steps if several persons have modified the same file. Don't worry, git will walk you through the necessary steps to fix the conflicts (see 3-git-advanced for more info on this).This is the equivalent of the `git pull` command.

#### Pushing

Once you have finished the pull process, you can click on the `push` button to upload your changes to GitHub and share your work with others. This is the equivalent of the `git push` command.
 
<img style="float: left;width: 50px;" src=images/tip.png /> On the RStudio git panel, the order of the buttons from left to right matches the sequence of actions you need to follow to submit your changes to the GitHub repository!
